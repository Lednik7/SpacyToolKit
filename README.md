## Getting started
### Installing: ###

```
!git clone https://github.com/Lednik7/SpacyToolKit.git
!python -m pip install -r SpacyToolKit/requirements.txt
```
### Needed packages: ###
For the library to work correctly, you need to download packages
```python
pip install spacy
pip install googletrans
pip install pymorphy2==0.8
pip install sklearn
pip install numpy
```

## Your first model ##

### Prerequisites: ###

Before you run the code below, you need to install one of the models:
```python
Russian models:
!git clone -b v2.1 https://github.com/buriy/spacy-ru.git && cp -r ./spacy-ru/ru2/.
English models:
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm #size 11 mb
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_md #size 48 mb
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg #size 746 mb
```

### Simple model: ###

To begin, we import the necessary functions and the main class:
```python
from SpacyToolKit.Tools import SpacyTools, sort_doc
from SpacyToolKit.other import get_translate
import en_core_web_sm #!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
Now create an instance of the class:
```python
model = SpacyTools()
```
Since the model works best in English, weâ€™ll use a translation from Google:
```python
text = model.sample_text #your text
trans = get_translate(text) #text translation into english
```

Now we are ready to load the text into the model and make a prediction:
```python
model.load_text(trans)
nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()
doc = model.create(nlp)
```
Let's look at the result:
```python
print(sort_doc(doc)) #filter the results
print(model.text)
```
Output:
```
